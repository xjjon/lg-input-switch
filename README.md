# lg-input-switch

Command-line input switcher for the **LG 45GX950A-B** monitor on Windows for nvidia GPUs.

## Background

The LG 45GX950A-B ignores standard DDC/CI input-switching commands sent via the Windows DDC/CI API. The root cause is that LG's firmware requires the DDC/CI source address `0x50` in the I2C packet, while Windows hardcodes `0x51` with no way to override it. Tools like ControlMyMonitor and Twinkle Tray both hit this limitation silently.

The fix is to bypass the Windows DDC/CI stack entirely and write the raw I2C packet directly via **NVAPI** (`NvAPI_I2CWrite`), which exposes the physical I2C bus on NVIDIA GPUs.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- NVIDIA GPU with up-to-date drivers (RTX series confirmed working)
- LG 45GX950A-B connected via DisplayPort or HDMI (USB-C confirmed working too)

## Installation

### Option A — pre-built executables (no Python required)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/meer-cha/lg-input-switch/releases) page and download the `.zip` from the latest release
2. Create a new folder anywhere (e.g. `C:\Users\You\LG Input Switch`)
3. Extract the contents of the zip into that folder
4. Run `lg-input-switch.exe` — it will guide you through setup on the first run, then start listening for your hotkey

> **Keep the window open.** The hotkey only works while the console window is running. You can minimize it — but closing it stops the hotkey listener. Minimizing to the system tray is not supported.

### Option B — run from source

Requires Python 3.10+. No third-party packages needed.

```
git clone https://github.com/meer-cha/lg-input-switch.git
cd lg-input-switch
python lg_switch.py configure
python lg_switch.py daemon
```

### Option C — build the executables yourself

Requires Python 3.10+ and pip.

```
git clone https://github.com/meer-cha/lg-input-switch.git
cd lg-input-switch
build.bat
```

The executables will be in the `dist\` folder.

## Usage

### Standalone executable

```
lg-input-switch.exe
```

On the first run it will walk you through choosing your two inputs and hotkey, then immediately start listening. On every subsequent run it goes straight to listening.

- Press `ESC` at any time to reconfigure your inputs or hotkey — you'll also be offered the option to enable or disable running at Windows startup
- Press `Ctrl+C` to exit
- The last active input is remembered so it always picks up where it left off

> **Windows startup:** after setup you'll be asked whether to start automatically with Windows. This writes a single value to `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` — no admin rights required. You can enable or disable it at any time by pressing `ESC` to reconfigure and navigating back to the startup screen.
>
> **Note:** Windows startup has not been fully tested — my machine has unrelated issues with startup apps, so this feature may or may not work on your system.

> **Console window:** the hotkey listener only works while the console window is running — you can minimize it, but closing it stops the listener. Minimizing to the system tray is not supported.

### From source

```
python lg_switch.py <input|command> [-v]
```

#### Inputs

| Argument | Input |
|----------|-------|
| `dp`     | DisplayPort |
| `hdmi1`  | HDMI 1 |
| `hdmi2`  | HDMI 2 |
| `usbc`   | USB-C / Thunderbolt |
| `scan`   | Detect connected outputs (no switch) |

#### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Print NVAPI debug info and per-attempt I2C results |
| `-h`, `--help`    | Show help and exit |

#### Examples

```
python lg_switch.py dp
python lg_switch.py usbc
python lg_switch.py --verbose hdmi1
python lg_switch.py scan
python lg_switch.py configure
python lg_switch.py daemon
```

### Hotkey format

Type the hotkey as `+`-separated tokens — do **not** press the keys, type the names:

| Token type | Examples |
|------------|---------|
| Modifiers  | `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `win` |
| Letters    | `a`–`z` |
| Digits     | `0`–`9` |
| F-keys     | `f1`–`f12` |
| Navigation | `insert`, `delete`, `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down` |
| Numpad digits | `numpad0`–`numpad9` |
| Numpad operators | `numpad+`, `numpad-`, `numpad*`, `numpad/`, `numpad.` |
| Symbols    | `;` `:` `=` `,` `-` `_` `.` `/` `` ` `` `[` `]` `\` `'` and their shifted variants |
| Space/Enter/Esc/Tab | `space`, `enter`, `esc`, `tab` |

Examples: `ctrl+shift+d`, `alt+f1`, `ctrl+numpad1`, `ctrl+shift+;`

#### Hotkey restrictions

- At least one modifier (`ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, or `win`) is required — except F-keys (`f1`–`f12`) which may be used alone
- `shift` alone with a typeable character is blocked (e.g. `shift+/` just types `?`)
- The following are reserved and cannot be used: `esc` (reconfigure), `ctrl+c` (exit)
- Common Windows shortcuts are blocked: `ctrl+v`, `ctrl+x`, `ctrl+z`, `ctrl+a`, `ctrl+s`

## How it works

DDC/CI uses I2C to send monitor control commands. A `SetVCP` packet to switch inputs looks like this:

```
[src, length, opcode, vcp_code, value_hi, value_lo, checksum]
 0x50  0x84    0x03    0xF4      0x00      0xD0      <xor>
```

The key byte is `src = 0x50`. Windows sends `0x51` — the LG silently drops it.

NVAPI exposes `NvAPI_I2CWrite`, which writes raw bytes to the physical I2C bus with no OS-level DDC/CI wrapping. The script constructs the packet manually with `0x50` as the source address and sends it directly.

The LG also uses a **proprietary VCP code `0xF4`** for input selection rather than the standard `0x60`. The input values are:

| Value  | Input |
|--------|-------|
| `0x90` | HDMI 1 |
| `0x91` | HDMI 2 |
| `0xD0` | DisplayPort |
| `0xD1` | USB-C / Thunderbolt |

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing happens, no error** — check that DDC/CI is enabled in the monitor OSD.

**`nvapi64.dll` not found** — NVIDIA drivers are not installed or not on the system PATH.

**All attempts fail with `err -1`** — run `python lg_switch.py scan` and check the output mask. If it returns `0x00000000`, the GPU is not detecting the monitor on its I2C bus (try a different cable or port). Run with `--verbose` to see per-attempt results.

**Daemon hotkey does nothing** — another application may have registered the same hotkey. Try a different combination.

**Want to change inputs or hotkey** — press `ESC` while the daemon is running to reconfigure.
